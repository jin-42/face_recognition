# Facial Recognition Project

## Overview

This project implements facial detection using the `face_recognition` library in Python. It provides a simple demonstration of the magic of facial recognition by detecting faces in an image and framing them with red rectangles. The interactive script prompts the user to provide the path to an image, then uses the `face_recognition` module to detect and visualize the faces present.

## Features

- Face detection in an image.
- Graphical display of detected faces with red rectangles.
- Utilizes the `matplotlib` library for visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install face_recognition matplotlib
